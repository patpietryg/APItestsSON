# APItestsSON


## Cat API

Why CatAPI? Because everyday is a Caturday. ;)

But seriously why I chose this API is because it has an API key that was easy to obtain and has basic request. At first I didn't notice that there was no PUT command, but I think I did it well.
I used postman to test the cat API. It is an important test automation tool and widely used.

## Goals API

Goal API was created during classes at the university. It was quite simple to write requests with curl.
